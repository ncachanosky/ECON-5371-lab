Lab 6: Volatility Models -- ARCH, GARCH, GJR-GARCH
=====================================================

Applies the ARCH-LM test, GARCH(1,1) estimation, and GJR-GARCH(1,1)
estimation to synthetic daily returns with genuine volatility
clustering and a genuine leverage effect (asymmetric response to
negative shocks).

Two functions used in this lab live in functions.py, in this same
folder -- each followed by a quick assert-based sanity check. See
that file's docstring for what this checks and why.

Run this script section by section (recommended: in Positron, run cell
by cell using the '# %%' markers), or top to bottom as a single script.

# Discussion: Do you see periods of calm alternating with periods of
# large swings? That pattern -- volatility clustering -- is what
# ARCH/GARCH models are built to capture. A plain ARMA model, which
# only models the MEAN, has no way to represent this at all.


# %% 2. Test for ARCH Effects

arch_lm_result = run_arch_lm_test(returns, nlags=CONFIG["arch_lm_lags"], label="daily returns")

# Discussion: The ARCH-LM test regresses squared returns on their own
# lags. Why would clustering in volatility show up as predictability
# in SQUARED returns, even though the returns themselves are close to
# unpredictable?


# %% 3. Fit GARCH(1,1)
#
# sigma_t^2 = omega + alpha*eps_{t-1}^2 + beta*sigma_{t-1}^2
#
# GARCH(1,1) treats a positive and a negative shock of the same size
# as equally important for tomorrow's volatility -- it only sees the
# SQUARED shock, which erases the sign.

garch = arch_model(returns, mean=CONFIG["mean_spec"], vol="GARCH", p=1, q=1, dist="normal")

print(garch_fit.summary())

# Discussion: Look at alpha[1] + beta[1]. This sum measures how
# persistent volatility shocks are -- close to 1 means today's
# turbulence fades slowly. What does the estimated sum suggest here?


# %% 4. Fit GJR-GARCH(1,1)
#
# sigma_t^2 = omega + alpha*eps_{t-1}^2 + gamma*I(eps_{t-1}<0)*eps_{t-1}^2
#             + beta*sigma_{t-1}^2
#
# The new term, gamma, ONLY activates when yesterday's shock was
# negative (I(eps_{t-1}<0) = 1). This is the "leverage effect": bad
# news is allowed to raise volatility by more than equally-sized good
# news does.

gjr = arch_model(returns, mean=CONFIG["mean_spec"], vol="GARCH", p=1, o=1, q=1, dist="normal")
gjr_fit = gjr.fit(disp="off")

print(gjr_fit.summary())

# Discussion: Is gamma[1] statistically significant? If it is, what
# does that tell you about how this series responds to bad news
# versus good news of the same size -- something plain GARCH(1,1)
# cannot represent at all?


# %% 5. Compare the Two Models

comparison = compare_garch_models(
    [garch_fit, gjr_fit],
    ["GARCH(1,1)", "GJR-GARCH(1,1)"],
)

# Discussion: Which model does AIC favor? Does that match your
# conclusion about gamma[1]'s significance in Section 4? A model with
# one more parameter should only "win" if that parameter is doing
# real work -- is that the case here?


# %% 6. Conditional Volatility and Residual Diagnostics
#
# The fitted conditional volatility (sigma_t) is the model's own
# estimate of how turbulent each day was. Standardized residuals
# (return / sigma_t) should look like plain white noise -- if the
# model correctly captured the volatility pattern, dividing by its own
# volatility estimate should remove the clustering entirely.

# Discussion: Re-running the ARCH-LM test on the standardized
# residuals -- does it now fail to reject H0? What would it mean if
# ARCH effects were STILL present after fitting GJR-GARCH?


# %% 7. ACF of Squared Standardized Residuals
#
# A second, visual check of the same idea: if volatility clustering
# is fully captured, the ACF of squared standardized residuals should
# show no significant spikes.
