"""
Lab 5: Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)
==============================================

Applies the Johansen cointegration test and VECM estimation to a
synthetic short-rate / long-rate pair -- a classic cointegrated system,
matching the textbook's own yield-curve example.

The Johansen test formatter lives in functions.py, in this same
folder. See that file's docstring for why.

Two new practices this lab:

  1. A CONFIG block, right after imports, collecting every value you
     might reasonably want to change -- file path, test settings,
     lag order, plotting options -- in one place at the top of the
     script. Compare this to earlier labs, where a setting like
     chosen_lag = 2 was buried inside a section halfway through the
     file. Read the CONFIG section before anything else; you should
     be able to adjust this whole lab's behavior without touching any
     code below it.

  2. ERROR HANDLING around the data load. Every lab so far has read
     data from a raw GitHub URL -- and every lab has had at least one
     moment where a wrong URL produced a long, unfriendly traceback.
     Section 1 below wraps that load in a try/except block that
     catches the likely failure and prints a short, actionable
     message instead.

Run this script section by section (recommended: in Positron, run cell
by cell using the '# %%' markers), or top to bottom as a single script.
